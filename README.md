Fun practice, following [this](https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/webOS) tutorial and its [implementation](https://www.codedex.io/community/project-showcase/t1GelXhxg4EARnCr5qXp) to advance my CSS skills (for now)
and create a cool "replica" of my Windows 7 Desktop from my childhood.

Main focus is to explore CSS and follow the tutorial's approach and end goal - create a "WebOS"!
